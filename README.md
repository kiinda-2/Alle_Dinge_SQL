## Google Capstone Project
<ins></ins>
I analyzed Cyclistic dataset using R, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. Created an interactive Power BI dashboard showing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. I also provided marketing strategies to convert casual riders to annual members.

 ### ðŸš²Background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing program which features more than 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. It was founded in 2016 and has grown tremendously into a fleet of bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system any time.

 
 ### Insights
1.	Members had the most rides at 64% of the total. The average ride length is 16 minutes with casual riders having the longest average time of 23 minutes while members have 12 minutes.
2.	The most popular bikes were classic bikes for both but casual riders alone used docked bikes.
3.	Members mostly used bikes equally throughout weekdays, with an increase on Wednesday and Thursday while casual riders mostly during weekends with an increase from Wednesday to Sunday and less on Mondays.
4.	The busiest time when riders rode was in the afternoon. Riding time rose from 6 AM to 5 PM then started dropping from 6 PM. Nighttime, 3 AM least busy
5.	Summer (June to August) was the busiest for both riders, more so during August. They rode less during Winter, especially during January.

 ### Summary
1.	Most riders by user type were members
2.	Average ride length was 23 minutes, with casual members riding 11 more minutes than members
3.	The most popular bike among riders was the classic bike.
4.	Afternoon was the busiest time with 5 PM being the peak for both riders.
5.	Saturday was the busiest day of the week, casual riders mostly use bikes on weekends
6.	Summer was the busiest season


 ### Suggestions
It was difficult to figure out since I have never been in this kind of scenario yet but this is what I would have suggested to convert casual users to members
â€¢	To personalize discounts depending on preference as well as during Summer which was the busiest time of year.
â€¢	Encourage new users to join by having members share their experiences of how Cyclistic has been for them to create a sense of community.


 ####What I learned
â€¢	Using R for cleaning and analysis (sharpening the skills I learned from the course)
â€¢	Creating visualizations in Power BI, using different visualizations as well as adding slicers to filter data

 #### I welcome any feedback to improve the project
